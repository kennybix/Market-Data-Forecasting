# Market-Data-Forecasting

This repository contains sample market data along with utilities for training forecasting models.

## Usage

A new script `forecast_strategy.py` demonstrates how to train a RandomForest model on the provided training data and evaluate it on the test set.

Run the script with:

```bash
python forecast_strategy.py
```

It will output the first few predictions along with evaluation metrics (MSE, R2, Directional Accuracy).
